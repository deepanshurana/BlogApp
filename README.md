# BlogApp - <Powered by Django> 


# Main Freatures!

  - Create or update your blog posts. Comment the posts and join the thread mechanism 
  - User authenticated web application that handles both authentication and authorization. 
  - The authentication system in Django aims to be very generic and doesnâ€™t provide some features commonly found in web authentication systems. Solutions for some of these common problems have been implemented in third-party packages:

    -Password strength checking
    -Throttling of login attempts
    -Authentication against third-parties (OAuth, for example)
    -Object-level permissions

### Installation
